<h2>Welcome to OpenIndiana â€“ A Community Distribution of Oracle
OpenSolaris</h2>
<p>OpenIndiana is a distribution of OpenSolaris, constructed by the
community, for the community. Our primary goal is to be a binary
and package compatible drop-in replacement for the official Oracle
OpenSolaris distribution.</p>
<p>This project was created to address the longstanding issue that
the OpenSolaris distribution is constructed entirely by Sun/Oracle,
not by the community. Depending on a single commercial entity has
led to several issues, notably that bug fixes and security updates
are only available via a paid for support subscription, that
community participation has been limited in steering the direction
of the operating system, and that commercial decisions within
Sun/Oracle have led to delays with the latest release.</p>
<p>We believe that this distribution is a necessary next step in
the evolution of the OpenSolaris legacy, one that the wider
community has been desperately waiting for. By engaging the
community, we can deliver true transparency, deliver regular
security updates and bug fixes, and bring peace of mind to our
users by providing a certain future for the operating system.</p>
<h2>Independence and Cooperation</h2>
<p>OpenIndiana is about gaining independence and security, whilst
cooperating and sharing our efforts with Oracle to benefit the
greater OpenSolaris community. We intend to foster a friendly, open
and active environment for developers to join us and get involved,
to develop the operating system in new directions and take it to
levels that were simply not possible under Sun/Oracle's
stewardship.</p>
<p>Together with the Illumos project we will work hard in order to
replace the remaining closed source binaries with open-sourced
equivalents, making the OpenIndiana distribution a true open source
operating system. We hope that this will speed adoption and
acceptance within the open source community.</p>
<p>We are committed to make developing the OpenSolaris operating system
easier than ever, by fully documenting the build process and
enhancing it to the point that anyone can quickly and easily get
involved and compile the operating system from scratch.</p>
<p>Lastly, we intend to enhance the OpenSolaris operating system's
ease of use, such that Linux users can make the transition with as
little pain as possible. Key examples of how we intend to do this
include making far more free and open source software available for
our distribution, as well as keeping this software up to date. We
also believe OpenSolaris excels as a server platform, with
enterprise features found in no other operating system, such as the
ZFS filesystem, Zones, the Service Management Framework, the Fault
Management system, the COMSTAR iSCSI/FCoE framework, and the
Crossbow virtualised network stack. We intend to make it easier
than ever to install OpenSolaris on servers, by providing
additional installation options on the live CD, and enhancing the
Automated Installer for automated network installs.</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
OpenIndiana is part of the Illumos Foundation, built by volunteers and
enthusiasts from around the world. Currently build servers, hosting
and bandwidth is donated by EveryCity hosting in the UK.
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<p>Our success as a distribution depends upon the success of our
community, which is why we would like to invite all those
interested in the future of OpenSolaris to participate and get
involved!</p>
<p>We have many resources from which you can get started, including
our Wiki, Mailing Lists and IRC Channel. We have development
servers available which can be booked, publicly available IPS
development repositories for updating to the latest builds, and
mercurial repositories for checking out the latest source code.</p>
<p>Further, we have a list of vacancies on our website which we are
actively seeking to fill, see our website for the details.</p>
